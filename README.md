# Wk11-JS-buttonNamePrompt

There are 2 versions of this same page with a button that launches javascript code. 
The javascript then prompts a user for their name.
The javascript uses the name feedback from the user to construct a greeting message.

The 1st version uses an in-page <script> - see: <a href="buttonNamePrompt.html">buttonNamePrompt.html</a>
The 2nd version uses an external / separate .js file that is referenced from the html - see: buttonNamePromptExternal.html &
the file buttonNamePrompt.js.
